 * Mode, and NO entry here loads a plugin until that is turned off — which is a security
 * decision belonging to the person opening the vault, not to a build script. It is also
 * the kind of claim to refuse on trust: the setting is Obsidian's own, it cannot be
 * exercised here, and a script that wrote it and was wrong would leave a plugin that
 * silently never loads with a message saying it had. So the run that creates the list
