/**
 * The headless capture script's wiring — the shape `lint-edited.test.ts` checks for the
 * edit-loop hook, applied to `scripts/harness-shot.mjs`: an npm script names a file that
 * exists, and the devDependency the file needs is declared, and declared as the browserless
 * package rather than the one that downloads a browser on every `npm install`.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT do: launch a browser, start the harness's dev server, or
 * assert anything about a screenshot. `scripts/harness-shot.mjs` draws; there is no
 * baseline to diff a PNG against, and driving Playwright here would trade this suite's
 * speed for a check `npm run harness-shot`, run by hand, already gives a developer directly.
